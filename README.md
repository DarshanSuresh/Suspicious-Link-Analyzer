# Suspicious Link Analyzer ðŸš¨

## Overview
Suspicious links pose a significant cybersecurity threat by exploiting deceptive URLs to trick users into accessing malicious websites or divulging sensitive information. This project aims to mitigate such risks by leveraging **Machine Learning** and **Deep Neural Networks** to detect and classify potentially harmful links. Using a carefully curated dataset of both malicious and benign URLs, we extract critical features to train and evaluate various models for optimal performance.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯
The goal is to analyze and predict malicious URLs by:
1. Extracting essential features from domain, HTML content, and address bars.
2. Training multiple machine learning models to classify URLs as "suspicious" or "legitimate."
3. Evaluating model accuracy and fine-tuning for maximum detection capability.
